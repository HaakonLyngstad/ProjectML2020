                One of the techniques we have used to increase the precision of our model predictions 
                is a method called bootstrap aggregation, or bagging for short. This method is split into two parts,
                bootstrapping and aggregating ("Aptly named this method is" - Yoda).
                The theory is quite simple: combining the predictions of many models will yield a
                on average more accurate prediction. We train a number of similar models, and use their average as 
                our final predictions.

                Bootstrapping
            </h2>
            <p class="w3-large w3-center">
                Bootstrapping is a way to handle training data. If we trained all our sepereate models on 
                the same exact data, their faults would probably be pretty similar. Due to some elements of
                chance there would be some variation, but not much.
